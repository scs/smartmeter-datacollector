The `smartmeter-datacollector` tool is a Python3 software which allows you to continuously retrieve data from supported smart meters (listed below).
The acquired values can be forwarded to one or more data sinks like a MQTT broker or logger.

This tool is an open source software funded by **[EKZ (Elektrizitätswerke des Kantons Zürich)](https://www.ekz.ch)** and developed by **[Supercomputing Systems AG](https://www.scs.ch)**. The goal of this voluntary initiative is to create a tool that can read, decode and decrypt data (if necessary) from the local interface of various smart meters and convert it into human-readable and simple formats. This should eliminate the complexity of decoding DLMS and similar protocols for the user. The user has the data in a format, which he can easily use in various use-cases ranging from simple vizualization (see [Method 1: Raspberry Pi image with demo](#method-1-raspberry-pi-image-with-demo)) to integration into energy management algorithms or into custom home automation software. 

The following smart meters are supported:

* Landis+Gyr E450: \
  Data pushed by smart meter over CII interface (wired M-Bus). Encoded with HDLC and DLMS/COSEM.
  * Unencrypted data
  * Encrypted data
* Iskraemeco AM550: \
  Data pushed by smart meter over [P1 interface (DSMR)](https://www.netbeheernederland.nl/_upload/Files/Slimme_meter_15_a727fce1f1.pdf). Encoded with HDLC (IEC 62056-46) and DLMS/COSEM.
  * Unencrypted data
  * Encrypted data

The following data sinks are implemented:
* MQTT (v3.1.1):
  * Encryption
    * Unencrypted connection
    * Encrypted connection
      * TLS
      * optional custom CA certificate
  * Authentication
    * Unauthenticated
    * Authenticated with username / password
    * Authenticated with client certificate
* Logger to STDOUT

`smartmeter-datacollector` is fully configurable through a `.ini` configuration file. The [`smartmeter-datacollector-configurator`](https://github.com/scs/smartmeter-datacollector-configurator) webinterface can help to create and modify the configuration.

# How to install

There are different methods how to use `smartmeter-datacollector`.

1. Raspberry Pi image with demo
2. Python package
3. Debian package

## Method 1: Raspberry Pi image with demo

For a very easy first time usage of `smartmeter-datacollector` we provide a [Raspberry Pi image](https://github.com/scs/smartmeter-datacollector/releases) (based on Raspberry Pi OS) which contains the following parts:
* `smartmeter-datacollector` as a systemd service
* `smartmeter-datacollector-configurator` webinterface
* demo
  * [mosquiotto](https://mosquitto.org/) as a local MQTT broker to publish the measurements from `smartmeter-datacollector`
  * [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/) to collect measurements published by `smartmeter-datacollector` over MQTT and store them in InfluxDB
  * [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) to store the measurements
  * [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) to visualize the measurements

This setup allows a (first time) user to [install](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#installing-the-operating-system) the image on a Raspberry Pi and immediately get started with `smartmeter-datacollector`. The following steps are required:
1. Download the Raspberry Pi image from the [latest release](https://github.com/scs/smartmeter-datacollector/releases).
2. Install the image on a (micro)SD card, e.g. using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#using-raspberry-pi-imager).
3. Prepare the Raspberry Pi.
   1. Push the (micro)SD card into the proper slot.
   2. Use an RJ-45 cable (or configure WiFi later) to connect to a network.
   3. Connect the power cable to the Micro USB port.
4. Open the `smartmeter-datacollector-configurator` webinterface using `http://<Raspberry Pi IP>:8000/` in your favorite browser.
   1. Load the pre-defined configuration.
   2. Adjust the settings of the connected smart meter.
   3. Deploy the adjusted configuration.
   4. Restart the `smartmeter-datacollector` service.
5. Open `Grafana` using `http://<Raspberry Pi IP>:3000/` in your favorite browser.
6. Observe the measurements from your smart meter while they arrive periodically.

See [Wiki/Demo](https://github.com/scs/smartmeter-datacollector/wiki/Demo-(Raspberry-Pi-Image)) for more details on the provided Raspberry Pi image with the demo.

## Method 2: Python package

`smartmeter-datacollector` can be installed as a Python3 package either from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/smartmeter-datacollector/) or manually using a [released wheel](https://github.com/scs/smartmeter-datacollector/releases).

The Python3 package does not contain any infrastructure to run `smartmeter-datacollector` in the background or to automatically start it during a boot sequence. If such infrastructure is required either see [Method 3: Debian package](#method-3-debian-package) or provide it yourself.

### Python Requirements

* Python >= 3.7 (tested with 3.8)

### Installation

Install the package either as global Python package or in a virtualenv with

```bash
python3 -m pip install smartmeter-datacollector
```

Similarly the [`smartmeter-datacollector-configurator`](https://github.com/scs/smartmeter-datacollector-configurator) webinterface can be installed with

```bash
python3 -m pip install smartmeter-datacollector-configurator
```

## Method 3: Debian package

`smartmeter-datacollector` is also available as a Debian (`.deb`) package from the [releases](https://github.com/scs/smartmeter-datacollector/releases) which installs it system wide. The Debian package includes a systemd service file which enables `smartmeter-datacollector` to automatically start after booting the system.

### Debian Requirements

* Distribution
  * Debian
* Release
  * Buster
* CPU architecture
  * amd64
  * armhf

### Installation

Download the Debian package from [releases](https://github.com/scs/smartmeter-datacollector/releases) and install it with

```bash
sudo apt install ./python3-smartmeter-datacollector_*.deb
```

Similarly the [`smartmeter-datacollector-configurator`](https://github.com/scs/smartmeter-datacollector-configurator) webinterface can be installed with a Debian package from its [releases](https://github.com/scs/smartmeter-datacollector-configurator/releases) with

```bash
sudo apt install ./python3-smartmeter-datacollector-configurator_*.deb
```

# How to use

The usage of `smartmeter-datacollector` depends on the installation method. Independent of the installation method a `.ini` configuration file is required to properly run `smartmeter-datacollector`.

## Configuration

### Specification

The `.ini` configuration file supports the following format

```ini
[reader0]
# type of the connected smart meter
type = lge450
# serial port to which the smart meter is connected
port = /dev/ttyUSB0
# optional encryption key
key = 

[sink0]
# type of the sink
type = mqtt
# host / IP address of the MQTT broker
host = localhost
# port of the MQTT broker
port = 1883
# whether to use TLS (Transport Layer Security)
tls = False
# optional path to the CA certificate used to validate the MQTT broker's certificate
ca_file_path = 
# whether to check the hostname of the MQTT broker against the certificate
check_hostname = False
# optional username for authentication with the MQTT broker
username = 
# optional password for authentication with the MQTT broker
password = 
# optional path to the client certificate for authentication with the MQTT broker
client_cert_path = 
# optional path to the private key for the client certificate for authentication with the MQTT broker
client_key_path = 

[sink1]
# type of the sink
type = logger
# name of the logger
name = DataLogger

# [sink2]
# # type of the sink
# type = csv
# # folder where files are saved to
# directory = path_to_csv_files

[logging]
# log level configuration: DEBUG / INFO / WARNING / ERROR
default = WARNING
smartmeter = WARNING
collector = WARNING
sink = WARNING
```

There can be multiple `[readerX]` and `[sinkY]` sections for every connected smart meter and / or data sink.

See [Wiki/Configuration](https://github.com/scs/smartmeter-datacollector/wiki/Configuration) for more details on the available configuration options.

### smartmeter-datacollector-configurator

To simplify the process of generating a valid `.ini` configuration for `smartmeter-datacollector` the companion [`smartmeter-datacollector-configurator`](https://github.com/scs/smartmeter-datacollector-configurator) webinterface can be used. It supports
* a graphical approach to manage the configuration
* input validation to avoid invalid configurations
* loading / saving / discarding a configuration
* restarting `smartmeter-datacollector` (only if installed as a Debian package)

See [Wiki/smartmeter-datacollector-configurator](https://github.com/scs/smartmeter-datacollector/wiki/smartmeter-datacollector-configurator) for more details on the webinterface and the configuration possibilities.

## Run manually

Run `smartmeter-datacollector` with the following command:

```
smartmeter-datacollector --config datacollector.ini
```

The following command line arguments are supported:
* `-h, --help`: Shows the help output of `smartmeter-datacollector`.
* `-c, --config CONFIG`: Path to the `.ini` configuration file.
* `-s,--saveconfig`: Cteate a default `.ini` configuration file.
* `-d, --dev`: Enable development mode.

### Configuration

The configuration file can be located anywhere and use any filename. If no `.ini` configuration file is specified a default configuration with the following options is used:
* Landys+Gir E450 smart meter in unencrypted mode connected to `/dev/ttyUSB0`
* `LOGGER` sink
* `MQTT` sink connected to a local broker without encryption or authentication

## Run as a systemd service

When `smartmeter-datacollector` has been installed as a Debian package it provides a systemd .service file named `python3-smartmeter-datacollector.service`. Therefore the service can be managed using the `systemctl` command:

```
sudo systemctl start|stop|restart python3-smartmeter-datacollector
```

Enabling or disabling the service can also be managed using the `systemctl` command:

```
sudo systemctl enable|disable python3-smartmeter-datacollector
```

Inspecting the log messages can be done using the `journalctl` command:

```
journalctl -u python3-smartmeter-datacollector [-f]
```

### Configuration

The systemd service expectes the `.ini` configuration to be located at
`/var/lib/smartmeter-datacollector/datacollector.ini`. This is also the default location used by the [`smartmeter-datacollector-configurator`](https://github.com/scs/smartmeter-datacollector-configurator) webinterface to load and save the managed configuration.

# How to develop

Help from the community for the `smartmeter-datacollector` project is always welcome. Please follow the next few chapters to setup a working development environment.

## Development Requirements

* Python >= 3.7
* [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
* Optional software packages (Debian / Ubuntu)
  * python3-all
  * debhelper
  * dh-python
  * dh-systemd

## Installation

### Debian / Ubuntu

To install the listed minimal requirements run the following command:

```
sudo apt install git python3 pipenv
```

To install the optional requirements also run the following command:

```
sudo apt install python3-all debhelper dh-python dh-systemd
```

## Checkout the code

Use `git` to clone / checkout `smartmeter-datacollector` from GitHub using

```
git clone https://github.com/scs/smartmeter-datacollector.git
```

## Setup Development Environment

`smartmeter-datacollector` uses [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to manage its dependencies and setup a virtual environment. Run the following command to setup the initial development environment:

```
pipenv install --dev
```

This will install all runtime and development dependencies for `smartmeter-datacollector` in a new virtual environment. Now you are ready to start working on `smartmeter-datacollector`.

## Custom Commands / Workflows

`smartmeter-datacollector` offers a few custom `pipenv run` commands to simplify certain development workflows:
* `format_check` checks if the code follows the [`autopep8`](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) code formatting rules.
* `format` automatically adjusts the code to follow the `autopep8` code formatting rules.
* `isort_check` checks if the order of the import statements is correct using [`isort`](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/).
* `isort` automatically re-orders the import statements using `isort`.
* `lint_check` checks if the code follows the [`pylint`](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) rules defined in `pyproject.toml`.
* `lint` automatically adjust the code to follow the `pylint` rules defined in `pyproject.toml`.
* `license` makes sure every Python (`*.py`) file contains the proper license header.
* `build` builds a Python package which can be uploaded to [`PyPI`](https://pypi.org/project/smartmeter-datacollector/) using `twine`.
* `build_check` uses `twine` to check if the built Python package will be accepted by `PiPI`.
* `setup_check` checks whether the dependencies defined in `Pipfile` / `Pipfile.lock` are in sync with `setup.py`.
* `setup` synchronizes the dependencies defined in `Pipfile` / `Pipfile.lock` with `setup.py`.
* `debianize` creates a `debian/` directory used to build Debian source / binary packages.
* `build_srcdeb` builds a Debian source package which can be used to build a Debian (binary) package for any platform (e.g. using [`pbuilder`](https://pbuilder-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html))
* `build_deb` builds a Debian package for the current development plattform.

Make sure to run `format_check` / `format`, `isort_check` / `isort`, `lint_check` / `lint`, `license`, `setup_check` / `setup` before commiting changes to the repository to avoid unnecessary development cycles. `smartmeter-datacollector` uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/scs/smartmeter-datacollector/actions) to check if these rules apply.
